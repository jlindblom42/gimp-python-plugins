# Gimp Python Plugins (for personal use)

Only confirmed to be working with "Gimp 2.10.36". Mileage may vary with other versions.

# Installation

You can create hard links to your Gimp plugins folder for each of the scripts here using the script below:

* [hardlink-folders-to-gimp-plugins-folder.bat](hardlink-folders-to-gimp-plugins-folder.bat)

Once hard linked they should be detectable by Gimp after a fresh start.
