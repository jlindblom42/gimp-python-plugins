# Gimp Python Plugins (for personal use)

Only confirmed to be working with "Gimp 2.10.36". Mileage may vary with other versions.

These scripts are very specific to my use cases, feel free to take what's here and modify it to your own needs. Contributions welcome as well.

# Installation

You can copy the scripts to your Gimp plugins folder using the batch script below.  Just make sure the plugin path in the script is accurate to your fs.

* [hardlink-folders-to-gimp-plugins-folder.bat](hardlink-folders-to-gimp-plugins-folder.bat)

They should be detectable by Gimp after a fresh start.
